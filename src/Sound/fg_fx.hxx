/**
 * Generator for FlightGear sound effects.
 *
 * This module uses FGSoundMgr to generate sound effects based
 * on current flight conditions.  The sound manager must be initialized
 * before this object is.
 *
 * Note: this module supports two separate sound mechanisms concurrently.
 *
 * 1. This module will load and play a set of sound effects defined in an
 *    xml file and tie them to various property states.
 * 2. This modules also maintains a queue of 'message' audio files.  These
 *    are played sequentially with no overlap until the queue is finished.
 *    This second mechanims is useful for things like tutorial messages or
 *    background atc chatter.
