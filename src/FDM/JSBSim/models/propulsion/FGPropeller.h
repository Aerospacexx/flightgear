/** Propeller modeling class.
    FGPropeller models a propeller given the tabular data for Ct and Cp
    indexed by advance ratio "J". The data for the propeller is
    stored in a config file named "prop_name.xml". The propeller config file
    is referenced from the main aircraft config file in the "Propulsion" section.
    See the constructor for FGPropeller to see what is read in and what should
    be stored in the config file.<br>
