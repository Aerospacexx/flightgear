/** Models a fuel tank.
    @author Jon Berndt
    @see Akbar, Raza et al. "A Simple Analysis of Fuel Addition to the CWT of
    747", California Institute of Technology, 1998
<P>
    Fuel temperature is calculated using the following assumptions:
<P>
    Fuel temperature will only be calculated for tanks which have an initial fuel
    temperature specified in the configuration file.
<P>
    The surface area of the tank is estimated from the capacity in pounds.  It
    is assumed that the tank is a wing tank with dimensions h by 4h by 10h. The
    volume of the tank is then 40(h)(h)(h). The area of the upper or lower 
    surface is then 40(h)(h).  The volume is also equal to the capacity divided
    by 49.368 lbs/cu-ft, for jet fuel.  The surface area of one side can then be
    derived from the tank's capacity.  
<P>
    The heat capacity of jet fuel is assumed to be 900 Joules/lbm/K, and the 
    heat transfer factor of the tank is 1.115 Watts/sq-ft/K.
<P>
Configuration File Format

Definition of the tank configuration file parameters:
<pre>
<b>TYPE</b> - One of FUEL or OXIDIZER.
<b>XLOC</b> - Location of tank on aircraft's x-axis, inches.
<b>YLOC</b> - Location of tank on aircraft's y-axis, inches.
<b>ZLOC</b> - Location of tank on aircraft's z-axis, inches.
<b>RADIUS</b> - Equivalent radius of tank, inches, for modeling slosh.
<b>CAPACITY</b> - Capacity in pounds.
<b>CONTENTS</b> - Initial contents in pounds.
<b>TEMPERATURE</b> - Initial temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
