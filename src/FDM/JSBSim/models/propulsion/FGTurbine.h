CLASS DOCUMENTATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

/** This class models a turbine engine.  Based on Jon Berndt's FGTurbine module.
    Here the term "phase" signifies the engine's mode of operation.  At any given
    time the engine is in only one phase.  At simulator startup the engine will be
    placed in the Trim phase in order to provide a simplified thrust value without
    throttle lag.  When trimming is complete the engine will go to the Off phase,
    unless the value FGEngine::Running has been previously set to true, in which
    case the engine will go to the Run phase.  Once an engine is in the Off phase
    the full starting procedure (or airstart) must be used to get it running.
<P>
    - STARTING (on ground):
      -# Set the control FGEngine::Starter to true.  The engine will spin up to
         a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1).  This simulates the action of a
         pneumatic starter.
      -# After reaching %15 N2 set the control FGEngine::Cutoff to false. If fuel
         is available the engine will now accelerate to idle.  The starter will
         automatically be set to false after the start cycle.
<P>
    - STARTING (in air):
      -# Increase speed to obtain a minimum of %15 N2.  If this is not possible,
         the starter may be used to assist.
      -# Place the control FGEngine::Cutoff to false.
<P>
    Ignition is assumed to be on anytime the Cutoff control is set to false,
    therefore a seperate ignition system is not modeled.

Definition of the turbine engine configuration file parameters:
<pre>
<b>MILTHRUST</b> - Maximum thrust, static, at sea level, lbf.
<b>MAXTHRUST</b> - Afterburning thrust, static, at sea level, lbf
[this value will be ignored when AUGMENTED is zero (false)].
<b>BYPASSRATIO</b> - Ratio of bypass air flow to core air flow.
<b>TSFC</b> - Thrust-specific fuel consumption, lbm/hr/lbf
[i.e. fuel flow divided by thrust].
<b>ATSFC</b> - Afterburning TSFC, lbm/hr/lbf
[this value will be ignored when AUGMENTED is zero (false)]
<b>IDLEN1</b> - Fan rotor rpm (% of max) at idle
<b>IDLEN2</b> - Core rotor rpm (% of max) at idle
<b>MAXN1</b> - Fan rotor rpm (% of max) at full throttle [not always 100!]
<b>MAXN2</b> - Core rotor rpm (% of max) at full throttle [not always 100!]
<b>AUGMENTED</b>
  0 == afterburner not installed
  1 == afterburner installed
<b>AUGMETHOD</b>
  0 == afterburner activated by property /engines/engine[n]/augmentation
  1 == afterburner activated by pushing throttle above 99% position
  2 == throttle range is expanded in the FCS, and values above 1.0 are afterburner range
  [this item will be ignored when AUGMENTED == 0]
<b>INJECTED</b>
  0 == Water injection not installed
  1 == Water injection installed
