/** Models a generic rocket engine.
    The rocket engine is modeled given the following parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>Chamber pressure (in psf)</li>
        <li>Specific heat ratio (usually about 1.2 for hydrocarbon fuel and LOX)</li>
        <li>Propulsive efficiency (in percent, from 0 to 1.0)</li>
        <li>Variance (in percent, from 0 to 1.0, nominally 0.05)</li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, the following control inputs, operating characteristics, and
    location are required, as with all other engine types:
    <ul>
        <li>Throttle setting (in percent, from 0 to 1.0)</li>
        <li>Maximum allowable throttle setting</li>
        <li>Minimum working throttle setting</li>
        <li>Sea level fuel flow at maximum thrust</li>
        <li>Sea level oxidizer flow at maximum thrust</li>
        <li>X, Y, Z location in structural coordinate frame</li>
        <li>Pitch and Yaw</li>
    </ul>
    The nozzle exit pressure (p2) is returned via a
    call to FGNozzle::GetPowerRequired(). This exit pressure is used,
    along with chamber pressure and specific heat ratio, to get the
    thrust coefficient for the throttle setting. This thrust
    coefficient is multiplied by the chamber pressure and then passed
    to the nozzle Calculate() routine, where the thrust force is
    determined.
