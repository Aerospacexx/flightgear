The switch component is defined as follows (see the API documentation for more
information):

@code
<switch name="switch1">
  <default value="{property|value}"/>
  <test logic="{AND|OR}" value="{property|value}">
    {property} {conditional} {property|value}
    <test logic="{AND|OR}">
      {property} {conditional} {property|value}
      ...
    </test>
    ...
  </test>
  <test logic="{AND|OR}" value="{property|value}">
    {property} {conditional} {property|value}
    ...
  </test>
  ...
</switch>
@endcode

Also, see the header file (FGSwitch.h) for further details.

//    The bitmasked value choices are as follows:
//    unset: In this case (the default) JSBSim would only print
//       out the normally expected messages, essentially echoing
//       the config files as they are read. If the environment
//       variable is not set, debug_lvl is set to 1 internally
//    0: This requests JSBSim not to output any messages
//       whatsoever.
//    1: This value explicity requests the normal JSBSim
//       startup messages
//    2: This value asks for a message to be printed out when
//       a class is instantiated
//    4: When this value is set, a message is displayed when a
//       FGModel object executes its Run() method
//    8: When this value is set, various runtime state variables
//       are printed out periodically
//    16: When set various parameters are sanity checked and
//       a message is printed out when they go out of bounds
