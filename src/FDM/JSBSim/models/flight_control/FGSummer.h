/** Models a flight control system summing component.
    The Summer component sums two or more inputs. These can be pilot control
    inputs or state variables, and a bias can also be added in using the BIAS
    keyword.  The form of the summer component specification is:
<pre>
    \<COMPONENT NAME="name" TYPE="SUMMER">
      INPUT \<property>
      INPUT \<property>
      [BIAS \<value>]
      [?]
      [CLIPTO \<min> \<max> 1]
      [OUTPUT \<property>]
    \</COMPONENT>
</pre>
    Note that in the case of an input property the property name may be
    immediately preceded by a minus sign. Here's an example of a summer
    component specification:
<pre>
    \<COMPONENT NAME="Roll A/P Error summer" TYPE="SUMMER">
      INPUT  velocities/p-rad_sec
      INPUT -fcs/roll-ap-wing-leveler
      INPUT  fcs/roll-ap-error-integrator
      CLIPTO -1 1
    \</COMPONENT>
</pre>
    Note that there can be only one BIAS statement per component.
