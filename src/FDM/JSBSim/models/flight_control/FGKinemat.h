/** Encapsulates a kinematic (mechanical) component for the flight control system.
This component models the action of a moving effector, such as an aerosurface or
other mechanized entity such as a landing gear strut for the purpose of effecting
vehicle control or configuration. The form of the component specification is:

@code
<kinematic name="Gear Control">
  <input> [-]property </input>
  <traverse>
    <setting>
      <position> number </position>
      <time> number </time>
    </setting>
    …
  </traverse>
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<gain> {property name | value} </gain>]
  [<output> {property} </output>]
</kinematic>
@endcode

The detent is the position that the component takes, and the lag is the time it
takes to get to that position from an adjacent setting. For example:

@code
<kinematic name="Gear Control">
  <input>gear/gear-cmd-norm</input>
  <traverse>
    <setting>
      <position>0</position>
      <time>0</time>
    </setting>
    <setting>
      <position>1</position>
      <time>5</time>
    </setting>
  </traverse>
  <output>gear/gear-pos-norm</output>
</kinematic>
@endcode

In this case, it takes 5 seconds to get to a 1 setting. As this is a software
mechanization of a servo-actuator, there should be an output specified.
