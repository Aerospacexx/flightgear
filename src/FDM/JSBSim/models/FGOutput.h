/** Handles simulation output.
    OUTPUT section definition

    The following specifies the way that JSBSim writes out data.

    NAME is the filename you want the output to go to

    TYPE can be:
      CSV       Comma separated data. If a filename is supplied then the data
                goes to that file. If COUT or cout is specified, the data goes
                to stdout. If the filename is a null filename the data goes to
                stdout, as well.
      SOCKET    Will eventually send data to a socket output, where NAME
                would then be the IP address of the machine the data should be
                sent to. DON'T USE THIS YET!
      TABULAR   Columnar data. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
      TERMINAL  Output to terminal. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
      NONE      Specifies to do nothing. THis setting makes it easy to turn on and
                off the data output without having to mess with anything else.

    The arguments that can be supplied, currently, are

    RATE_IN_HZ  An integer rate in times-per-second that the data is output. This
                value may not be *exactly* what you want, due to the dependence
                on dt, the cycle rate for the FDM.

    The following parameters tell which subsystems of data to output:

    SIMULATION       ON|OFF
    ATMOSPHERE       ON|OFF
    MASSPROPS        ON|OFF
    AEROSURFACES     ON|OFF
    RATES            ON|OFF
    VELOCITIES       ON|OFF
    FORCES           ON|OFF
    MOMENTS          ON|OFF
    POSITION         ON|OFF
    COEFFICIENTS     ON|OFF
    GROUND_REACTIONS ON|OFF
    FCS              ON|OFF
    PROPULSION       ON|OFF

    NOTE that Time is always output with the data.
